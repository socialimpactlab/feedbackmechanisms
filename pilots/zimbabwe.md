In Zimbabwe, the [Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA)](http://www.adra.org.uk) integrated beneficiary feedback mechanisms (BFM) into their ongoing GPAF project, which aimed to improve maternal health care services for 7,500 women in Gokwe North District.

It was anticipated that collecting and responding to beneficiary feedback would provide greater insight into community views on service quality and factors that influence the access and use of maternal health and related services to women's health by women of childbearing age.
