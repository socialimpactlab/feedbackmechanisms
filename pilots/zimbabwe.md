### Adventist Development and Relief Agency

In Zimbabwe, the [Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA)](http://www.adra.org.uk) integrated beneficiary feedback mechanisms (BFM) into their ongoing GPAF project, which aimed to improve maternal health care services for 7,500 women in Gokwe North District.

It was anticipated that collecting and responding to beneficiary feedback would provide greater insight into some of the factors that influence access, use and quality of maternal and child health services.
