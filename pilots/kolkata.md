*Women learning about the feedback forms*

[Child in Need Institute](http://www.cini-india.org) is a local NGO supporting children, adolescents and women in disadvantaged areas of India.

In collaboration with [Child Hope UK](http://www.childhope.org.uk), CINI piloted a beneficiary feedback mechanism in its urban maternal and child health nutrition project in Kolkata.

The projectâ€™s goal is to reduce infant mortality and improve maternal health by facilitating access to government social welfare schemes and quality health services. [This paper]({{site.baseurl}}/public/files/Cinihealth.pdf) published by CINI provides their insight into how health and nutrition services were improved through feedback mechanisms.
