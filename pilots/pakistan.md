[Rahnuma](http://www.fpapak.org) is the Family Planning Association of Pakistan. Rahnuma piloted a beneficiary feedback mechanism in its urban education, health and poverty reduction Project. The project aimed to integrate education, health and income generation services for 14,000 school students, their mothers and families, in Pakistan.

This project targeted students to raise their awareness about nutrition and sexual reproductive and health issues, and to link them into Rahnumaâ€™s clinics and mobile camps. The project also provided micro-credit and skills development to the families of the most vulnerable students.
