title: Launch of our findings and new practitioner resources

---

Today we launch the findings and practitioner resources from a three-year pilot exploring how beneficiary feedback can support development programming.

Feedback mechanisms such as suggestion boxes, focus group discussions and mobile SMS and voice calls were trialled in seven projects working to improve maternal and child health. The mechanisms were found to support service users to hold projects and government services to account, and support projects to adapt to usersâ€™ needs and priorities.

The pilots encountered numerous challenges and learned lessons about implementing and adapting beneficiary feedback mechanisms on the ground. These lessons are documented in the resources made available today. The resources include a short film explaining the pilot, practice notes to support those implementing beneficiary feedback mechanisms in development programmes, a summary of findings from the pilot and case-studies from each of the seven countries.
