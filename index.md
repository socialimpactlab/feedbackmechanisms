## About the pilots
Between 2014 and 2016, the UK Department for International Development supported seven non-governmental organisations to pilot beneficiary feedback Mechanisms as part of their maternal and child health projects. The projects were funded under the department’s UK Aid Direct fund (previously known as the Global Poverty Action Fund). World Vision UK led a consortium to support their journey and learn:

* What makes a beneficiary feedback system effective?
* Does it improve accountability to communities and the delivery of projects?
* Is it worth the investment?

Monitoring and review support was provided by INTRAC UK and consultants in each of the six countries. Development and implementation of mobile-based beneficiary feedback mechanisms was supported by SIMLab, and learning from the pilots was supported by CDA.
