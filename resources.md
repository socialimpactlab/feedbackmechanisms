## Practice notes
The practice notes present practical tips for any organisation setting up beneficiary feedback mechanisms. They are intended to help you navigate the challenges and create a robust and user-friendly system.

The notes cover six areas of implementation:

* 	Transparency and awareness raising
* 	Inclusive and accessible feedback channels
* 	Internal referral processes
* 	External referral processes
* 	Communicating a response to feedback
* 	Resourcing for feedback systems

## Mobile technology case study

This beneficiary feedback approach sought to build on and test examples of beneficiary feedback and communication that utilised increasingly widespread mobile technology.

It envisioned an SMS-based feedback system which would provide 24 hour access to a two-way feedback mechanism.

In the inception phase, based on the expectation that literacy would be a barrier to feedback, this approach was broadened to include registration of missed calls to the helpline number, which would then be called back by the project Community Feedback Officer.

A literature review prepared by SIMLab at the outset of the project outlines the examples of such feedback mechanisms, and their potential and likely challenges.
